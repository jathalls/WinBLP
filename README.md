Bat Recording Log File Amalgamator
This program allows you to annotate a collection of .WAV files using Audacity by adding Label tracks to each file and exporting the Label tracks a separate .TXT files using the same name as the original .WAV file (by copying and pasting the Name fields).
This program can then be run to amalgamate all the .TXT files into a single .Log.Txt file, converting the Label files timing to hh:mm:ss.mmm format.
For bat recording analysis keywords in the labels can be recognised and annotated as proper bat names and passes (labels) will be summarised by bat type.
Full details of expected use can be found in the Help class file.
