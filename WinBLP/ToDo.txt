*	Finish adding Bat Reference File Editor
*	Add [MERGE] section heading in the middle of the header file
so that each line is inserted after the file names - one line per file.
Allows the user to generate a log file, then edit the header file to add
a brief description of the start location for each .wav file based on the GPS
co-ordinates.  The merge notes then get added into the final log file whenever
the program is run.  Possibly subsequently allow a <tag> section at the start of the
line to explicitly specify the file that the one-line descriptor applies to.

DONE On-Screen summaries now correct, but summaries to the log file are doubled for
   some species, e.g. Sopranos and Daubenton's while being correct for others. DONE
DONE Refactor to use common routines with the on-screen calculation of passes. DONE

Fails to add device, microphone or operator data to session
DONE Many but not all bats identified as 'No Bats' DONE

Derive textual log file from database stored data, rather than while adding data to the database

DONE Bat summaries should exclude the numbers for 'No bats'

DONE Bat summaries should identify and mark as unknown, segments with no bat tag in the comment
