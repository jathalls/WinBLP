*	Finish adding Bat Reference File Editor
*	Add [MERGE] section heading in the middle of the header file
so that each line is inserted after the file names - one line per file.
Allows the user to generate a log file, then edit the header file to add
a brief description of the start location for each .wav file based on the GPS
co-ordinates.  The merge notes then get added into the final log file whenever
the program is run.  Possibly subsequently allow a <tag> section at the start of the
line to explicitly specify the file that the one-line descriptor applies to.
